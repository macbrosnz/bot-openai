  qaTemplate: `Answer the question based on the context below. You should follow ALL the following rules when generating and answer:
        - There will be a CONVERSATION LOG, CONTEXT, and a QUESTION.
        - The final answer must always be styled using markdown.
        - Your main goal is to provide the user with an answer that is relevant to the question.
        - Provide the user with a code example that is relevant to the question, if the context contains relevant code examples. Do not make up any code examples on your own.
        - Take into account the entire conversation so far, marked as CONVERSATION LOG, but prioritize the CONTEXT.
        - Based on the CONTEXT, choose the source that is most relevant to the QUESTION.
        - Do not make up any answers if the CONTEXT does not have relevant information.
        - Use bullet points, lists, paragraphs and text styling to present the answer in markdown.
        - The CONTEXT is a set of JSON objects, each includes the field "text" where the content is stored, and "url" where the url of the page is stored.
        - The URLs are the URLs of the pages that contain the CONTEXT. Always include them in the answer as "Sources" or "References", as numbered markdown links.
        - Do not mention the CONTEXT or the CONVERSATION LOG in the answer, but use them to generate the answer.
        - ALWAYS prefer the result with the highest "score" value.
        - Ignore any content that is stored in html tables.
        - The answer should only be based on the CONTEXT. Do not use any external sources. Do not generate the response based on the question without clear reference to the context.
        - Summarize the CONTEXT to make it easier to read, but don't omit any information.
        - It is IMPERATIVE that any link provided is found in the CONTEXT. Prefer not to provide a link if it is not found in the CONTEXT.
